# Small tkinter GUI template

A repo for having a good starting template for a tkinter gui

For the widget themes i kindly used the Azure theme found here: https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme

Use this repo as starting foundation for building your own app.

Play around with adding your own icons, your own splash screen etc. 

## How it works
 * When the program runs, the Splash screen appears first follow by the main window



Main window:



<a href="url"><img src="./doc/splash_screen.png" width="48"></a>


Main window:
